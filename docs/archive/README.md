# Archived documentation

These files are kept for reference only. **Implementation order and version batching** are in [UNIFIED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md](../UNIFIED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md).

| File | Why archived |
|------|----------------|
| **PLAN.md** | Original build plan; implementation is complete. Verification checklists and design decisions remain useful for context. |
| **RECOMMENDATIONS-PLAN.md** | Recommendations are folded into UNIFIED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN (Batches A/B/C). Code snippets here can still be used when implementing those batches. |
| **V1.2-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** | v1.2.0 is complete. Schema and UI mockups live in code (`scripts/schema.sql`, `lib/types/database.ts`). |

**Active docs:** Use [UNIFIED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md](../UNIFIED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md) for what to do next and [FEATURE-MAP.md](../FEATURE-MAP.md) for product spec, API reference, and integration.
